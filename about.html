                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>This timeline is meant to help examine feminism and its history from the 19th century up to the
                        present day, as well as break down barriers within and without the movement. It does so by
                        adopting a distant, chronological view on inclusive data, and as such allows users to explore
                        feminism's history in a more self-directed way.</p>
                    <p>While originally made as part of a final year (2021/2022) research project in the BA Digital
                        Humanities & Information Technology course at University College Cork, it is hoped that this
                        open-source timeline will continue to be improved and added to by many people from a diverse
                        range of backgrounds and demographics.</p>
                    <p>It is inherently difficult, nigh on impossible, to
                        provide a broad, in-depth, and multi-faceted view of feminism with only one contributor. Even
                        though the foundational data seen here is heavily reliant upon the research work of others, the
                        data is still far from being as inclusive and worldwide as it could be. Feminism and its
                        historical records have unfortunately used discriminatory lenses, in many cases solely focusing
                        on the white, middle class American woman. This project seeks to provide a more encompassing
                        view of the movement's history, moving away from common categorizations and instead
                        encouraging users to explore the past in different ways.</p>
