# ⚠ WIP ⚠ <!-- omit in toc -->

A timeline meant to help examine feminism and its history from the 19th century up to the present day, as well as break down barriers within and without the movement. It does so by adopting a distant, chronological view on inclusive data, and as such allows users to explore feminism's history in a more self-directed way.

It can be viewed at [desiresoffeminism.github.io](https://desiresoffeminism.github.io/).
