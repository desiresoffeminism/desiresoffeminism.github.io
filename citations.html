                    <p>Every item in the timeline should have at least one citation. If it does not, please <a

                        and we will rectify this as soon as possible by providing a citation and/or removing the content
                        until one can be provided. The citations used in this project primarily follow the American
                        Psychological Association (APA) 7th edition citation style. However, as descriptions of timeline
                        items are meant to be quite short to aid readability, the method of indicating and linking
                        in-text citations to full-length citations is altered.</p>
